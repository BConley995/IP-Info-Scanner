# PowerShell Script for Configuration Maintenance

This repository contains a PowerShell script that is used for maintaining configuration files on a Windows computer.

## Functionality

The script performs checks on several XML configuration files and a `.DAT` file. It ensures that these files contain certain expected values. If these values are missing, the script copies predefined configuration files from a directory `C:\Windows\BCD\Fix\`. This is to ensure that the system or application works as expected with the correct configurations.

The script is specifically tailored to work with a particular application that stores its configuration files in the `C:\Program Files*\jDummy\I*\Config\` and `C:\WebA\` directories.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a PowerShell window.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the command `.\script_name.ps1`, replacing `script_name.ps1` with the actual script name.

## Logging

The script generates logs that are stored in `C:\Windows\BCD\Fix\Logs\`. It logs the start time, end time, and any discrepancies it finds in the configuration files.
